Crisis Collector
------------------

Have fun while learning about potential existential crises that face humanity!

Features
------------

* **Info Cards** - The heart and soul of the application. Every crisis has its own card displaying its name alongside a picture, description, and fun fact. 

* **A Personal Collection** - Decide whether or not each potential crisis is a concern to you. When presented with a new card, you can choose to either add it to your collection, or discard it and its frivolous implications forever!

* **Custom Card Creation** - One of the many wonderful things about existential possibilities is they are virtually limitless. Have an existential concern you just don't see in our stack of cards? Create your own! With our card creator, you can add as many custom cards as you like. The only boundaries are those of your imagination!

* **Trim the Fat** - Have a card in your collection that just doesn't resonate anymore? Maybe humanity has safeguarded itself from a potential threat and you want to shift your focus. Whatever the reason, if you'd like to remove a card from your collection, you can! Just remember, while there's impermanence in all things, some actions have far reaching consequences. Like this one for instance. Once the card is gone, it's gone!

Getting Started
------------------

### Setting it Up

Start by running ```yarn install``` inside both the main project folder and the client folder.

Then, start the servers using the command ```yarn dev``` while inside the main project folder.

You can now see the application at http://localhost:3000/. Nice!

### Notes on Functionality

* At present, rapidly clicking either of the card's accept/reject buttons will cycle through the card stack without providing the opportunity to view each card. Until this is resolved, patience is key!

* Each card must have a unique name in order to be added to your collection. 

* You may create a card even if all the form's input fields are empty. Until this input is made a requirement in a future release, contemplate on the philosophical significance of both vast and infinitesimal emptiness.

* You will need to provide an accurate and direct url in order for your custom card's picture to appear. Future releases will supply the option to upload a picture from your device.

* This application is not currently configured for mobile. Please enjoy the app's experience in your desktop web browser, preferably Google Chrome. Cross-browser and mobile compatibility will be available in future rollouts as well.
